    <h2>Memorable Quotes</h2> 
    <ul>
        <li>The Game. They say a person either has what it takes to play, or they don't. My mother was one of the greats. Me on the other hand... I'm kinda screwed. I can't think of any one reason why I'd want to be a surgeon. But I can think of a thousand reasons why I should quit. They make it hard on purpose. There are lives in our hands. There comes a moment when it's more than just a game. And you either take that step forward or turn around and walk away. I could quit, but here's the thing â€¦ I love the playing field</li>
        <li>You don't feel finished because this isn't the end for you. There is no finish line. There is no end point. You've just got to go
        </li>
        <li>The past is written. There's no changing it. What's done is done. But the future is ours to choose. For better, or for worse.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Surgical Breakthroughs/Successes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Doing single surgery in record time</li>
    <li>Abdominal Wall Transplant (Won the Catherin Fox Award)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4>Notes and Trivia</h4>
<ul>
    <li>First Patient was Katie Bryce</li>
    <li>When Meredith became an attending, she chose a plain purple scrub cap. After Her husband's death, she wore his favorite ferry boat scrub cap in his honor. At a later date, she "retired" his ferry boat scrub cap and switched to a different variation of her original purple scrub cap.
    </li>
    <li>Her pager extension is 2120</li>
    <li>Her glove size is 7.</li>
</ul>
